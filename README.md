# ReverseKruskal
This program finds a Minimum Spanning Tree for an undirected graph of the distance between different cities. The algorithm used is Reverse Kruskal which is the Kruskal algorithm, implemented in the opposite way. An implementation of this program is to find the minimum distance between 2 different places such as in maps.

Language: C++
